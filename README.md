Man, so I just walked out of Control Freak, and I'm like, whoa, what did I even just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩??? The theater was so loud, I can still hear it, like, echoing in my brain, like when you leave a concert and your ears are still buzzing, you know? I need to catch my breath—sitting down on this sticky bench, but let me try to piece this together for you... popcorn's all over my lap, totally grounded in reality but my head's spinning somewhere else.

The opening scene, right, it's like you're dumped into this chaotic mess like flipping a pool chair when I forget my sunscreen, and there's no easing in at all. It’s that character, the protagonist guy—he's got this vibe, like he’s controlling everything but nothing all at once, like trying to paddleboard and the board’s slipping from under you but somehow you’re still standing?

> I'm not even sure where this thing was going half the time. It's just AH!!! Like when you see a kid running around the pool deck and you're ready to whistle them back to safety, but in this case, no whistle, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 chaos. The tension was all these layers, like layers of latex paint someone peeled from the guard chair. So many layers.

And the scenes, they just smushed together like how all the towels get tossed in the back of the storage room after we close up—characters overlapping and lines crossing like those little currents by the buoys that mess with the floaties. Honestly, someone else asked if I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for them... I don't even know if you'll get it without the same loud room vibes.

The villain, my word, an intense shell of control, reminded me of seagulls—they look calm on the outside but could snatch a hot dog right from your hands. Quite absurd when you think about it, but that's the feel. They control but are unpredictably wild, and wow did it get there.

My back’s aching as if I’d spent the whole day pulling sunburnt tourists from the water... 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   so I can relive this confusion vicariously through you, yeah? Blurry dialogue, but maybe that’s just because my ribs were sticking to the seat with the heat of the room or whatever.

Ah, heck, there's like a bit where... something futuristic? Techie vibes unraveling fast, but they just doubled down. Gah, I’m lost in my explanations, but it’s good, the kind of good that leaves you wondering if it’s weird for weird’s sake, or maybe I’m just thinking too hard.
